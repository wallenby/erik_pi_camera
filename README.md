# My Pi Camera :)
My attempt at making a functional camera using a Raspberry Pi 4 and a High Quality Camera Module in addition to other parts.

I'm in the process of making a GUI that allows the user to preview the live feed of the camera, as well as control different camera settings (like the exposure, shutter speed, contrast, etc...) via buttons that will be conencted via the GPIO pins of the pi.

Furthermore, I will be applying my focus Neural Network once I have the user interface working properly so that I can obtain better focus in my pictures. 

##### First Version

(if you're wondering, those $1,000,000 bills are some random religious propaganda ploy that I found on the streets of my campus)  

THIS WAS A BOTCH! It was a concept to see if it would work and so I scramlbed some parts together and made the first version of the camera!

It contains the same base components (so Pi 4, HQ Camera, 4" Display) but it uses carboard for some parts, as well as an old portable battery bank for power, and it's still using an old c-mount lens which is over 70 years old! I later took apart this lens and I'm now using the aperature rings from it to adjust the aperature of the camera!
